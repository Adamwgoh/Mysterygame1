Unnamed Game.

note-to-self: "This belongs to project borderline studios"

This is an iOS game made with iPhone5 in mind ( no larger iphones out at that time!) about a RPG that you should be able to play with one hand.
The "game engine" runs ontop of cocos2d-x, which takes painfully alot of time, apparently my whole summer 13', to understand and develop.
The game narrative should change over time, with added gameplays over time as I get over with other stuffs.

- Uses Dollar gesture recognizer to detect gestures. No custom gestures other than the ones supported by the algorithm.
- Conversation engine is not working as it seemed yet, but able to have a branched storyline for now.
- All arts are taken from the internet, I should take them down anytime, no Copyrights Infringements intended!

They say posting your own code online is a brave and good thing to do. So here comes new habits for the new year!
